				<h2>Streamlining the endoscopic foreign body retrieval process.</h2>

				<p>A substantial concern often encountered as a pet owner is when the pet ingests foreign objects that should not be consumed. In many cases, immediate veterinary care must be taken to retrieve the foreign object before it causes gastrointestinal distress, which could harm or potentially even kill the animal. The most common offenders that require veterinary care to remove foreign bodies are dogs that range between 20-60 lbs, though other domesticated animals such as cats must also be considered. More often than not, these dogs eat objects ranging from coins, fruit pits, to balls of varying sizes. Several methods for retrieving these objects are readily available today, but endoscopic foreign body retrieval devices present a minimally-invasive surgical option with the potential for vast improvement in the veterinary clinical setting.</p>
				<p>To that end, our group aims to design a universal device that will allow the user to effectively retrieve objects of various sizes that will be both reusable and will require minimal training from the current standard. We will be working in conjunction with Dr. Erika de Papp of the Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston to provide us with her clinical expertise. Together, we hope to create a device that will serve as the golden standard for efficient and precise extraction of foreign objects.  </p>

				<p>This is my Senior Capstone Project, and I am extremely excited to be working on a device that could change the interface of endoscopic foreign body retrieval. We have developed a portfolio of devices that are designed for manufacture (DFM) and ready for production.</p>
